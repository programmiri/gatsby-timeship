IS YOUR FRONTEND SKILL BUILDING STUCK?
**Not sure how to motivate yourself** to get your frontend skill building unstuck from the suck zone? Do you remember how motivating it was to build a skill? Do you feel like you‚Äôre on a golden hamster wheel, you would get motivated of only you could get your skill building unstuck?

**You‚Äôve tried to educate yourself** about how to get your skill building out of this rut. You‚Äôve read a bunch of blogposts. You‚Äôve watched various videos. You‚Äôve attended a collection of courses ‚Äì **but you can‚Äôt figure out how to get motivated and get yourself unstuck from the suck zone?**

## IMAGINE IF YOUR FRONTEND SKILL BUILDING HAD TO GET UNSTUCK OR YOUR SISTER MIGHT DIE
Imagine this ‚Äì Imagine if your frontend skill building had to get unstuck or your sister might die. In prison. And if your princess sister stays in prison your whole city will be less civil and more hate filled. Ruby Reckless faces this challenge in her job as frontend engineer on her own TimeShip on London Bridge in 1554. Ruby must build a Gatsby function to get her TimeShip to work, so she can time travel to the future and get her skill building unstuck. **Your weekly frontend skill building matters to Ruby's motivation back in 1554.**

## JOIN RUBY RECKLESS ON A FEEL-GOOD-SKILL-BUILDING-QUEST TO SAVE HER SISTER FROM QUEEN MURDEROUS MARY'S MASTERPLAN

### Here‚Äôs How It Works:
Ruby's TimeShip A FRONTEND SKILL BUILDING QUEST TO JAILBREAK A SISTER will take place in a short sequence of emails. It's a story Lillian (6 üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏èüë∏ ) and I just started writing,  it will be over before you know it üò∫. Every Sunday, we will send you a tiny part of Ruby's TimeShip to help you stay motivated in your frontend skill building struggles that week.

## WAIT! DON‚ÄôT TAKE MY WORD FOR IT...
Here‚Äôs what engineers in Ruby's TimeShip have said:

I wish I could turn back the clock and
get weekly motivation reminders when I first started my frontend skill building - it would have saved me hours in the suck zone. I always thought I could FORCE myself to do frontend skill building - but I hit a wall and realized I needed help to get to next level of my own motivation game.

(ILLU: MARY1 / THE QUEEN OF BRITANNIA)

Dammit, if it wasn't for Ruby's frontend skill building MY iron hand would have ruled Britannia and Britannia would have Ruled the Waves. And then the Web. Forever....

Ruby is a wonderful opponent. She goes out of her way to make my life interesting and will challenge me and do the things that ‚Äì though I might not always want them done to me ‚Äì are crucial to keeping me motivated to build my skills as a scary super spy.

I'd be in prison in The Tower of London if it wasn't for Ruby's Programming Pirates. And you dear reader probably wouldn't have for example William Shakespear's plays and probably not your freedom of speech. Where would you have been without my years of golden rule and the following Golden Age of Pirates that in my humble opinion laid the groundwork for the American Constitution. Don't thank me, thank my half sister Ruby Reckless.

‚Äì Lizabeth, Princess of England and later Queen.

Ruby Reckless, you finally convinced me to drop trying to practice several programming skills at once. I‚Äôve now focused on Gatsby functions practice since the start of August 2021. Just wanted to say thank you.

### ABOUT THE AUTHOR
Hi! I‚Äôm Ola Vea and I wasn't always a JUST ANOTHER FRIENDLY Frontend Engineer I grew up at sea. I grew up in a city, but I spent every summer at sea onboard my father's ship full of youngsters. We crossed the North Sea looking like a sunny mirror and we crossed the North Sea with waves the size of our tiny, white, wood house where I now live with my wife Benedicte and our daughter Lillian (6 üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏èüë∏ ). If I had to choose ONE thing I learned from my seafaring life, it is this:

#### Learning by Doing.

Teaching us Learning by Doing was my father's purpose in life. His misson as a teacher and as a father.
And I guess when he died I inherited the Learning by Doing mission.

My father used his traditional sailing ship as a tool to show us that we already knew how to learn. My father made Learning by Doing easy and safe for his pupils and for my sister and for me and for our friends. My misson is to use your programming practice to show you that you already know how to learn.

## WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?
You‚Äôre running out of web page! Don‚Äôt spend another day believing that the solution to your programming practice woes is waiting around for motivation while you are distracted by something else.
