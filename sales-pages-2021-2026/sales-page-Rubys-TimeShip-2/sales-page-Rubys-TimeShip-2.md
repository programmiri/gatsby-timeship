## ARE YOU SICK OF YOUR SERVERLESS SKILL BUILDING BEING BORINGLY STUCK IN THE SUCK ZONE?
Not Sure Why It's So Important That You keep Building Your Best Programming Skill?
Your programming practice is unfocused. You feel like you‚Äôre on a hamster wheel, good new tools keep coming out all the time. The tools are just trying to help you, but how to find time to learn all the things? You‚Äôre trying harder than ever, but you don't feel like you are keeping up. You don't feel you are building your programming skills in the best way. You know you need to make a change, but every week you‚Äôre wasting your time being unfocused and/ or unmotivated.

You‚Äôve tried to educate yourself about how to get your programming practice out of this rut. You‚Äôve read a bunch of blogposts. You‚Äôve watched various videos. You‚Äôve attended a collection of courses ‚Äì but you can‚Äôt figure out how to apply any of it to motivate you in your programming practice.

## Imagine Knowing That If You Don't Keep Building BETTER SERVERLESS GATSBY FUNCTIONS a Princess Might Die DREADFULLY. In Prison.
Imagine Knowing That every hour you're mindfully practicing your Best Programming Skill moves the world one hour closer to saving a red haired Princess out of Prison. And from possible execution. Not only that. This particular Princess, Princess Lizabeth might just be the only person who could hold her index finger in the hole in the Dam of Civillity. If Lizabeth's index finger had been pulled away more than 444 years ago the dark forces of tyranny and intolerance might have started spilling through the Dam of Civillity. Slowly making the hole larger, and larger and LARGER and broken the dam of civillity. Our world today would have been darker, colder, less colorfull, less civil, less tolerant and more tyrannical. Lizabeth's half sister made a good go at a new tyrannical world order back in 1554, just google "Mary 1" and see for yourself.

Your weekly programming practice matters in 1554.

## JOIN RUBY RECKLESS ON A Feel-Good-QUEST TO SAVE HER SISTER AND SAVE HER CITY FROM QUEEN MURDEROUS MARY 1ST
Get a Feel Good Story To Remind You To Keep Your Best Programming Skill Fresh
Get motivated ‚Äì Often all it takes to keep you on track building your best programming skill is a weekly email reminder about how important your skill building is to people around you, even people in the past.

### Here‚Äôs How It Works:
Ruby's TimeShip will take place in a short sequence of emails, it will be over before you know it üò∫. It's going to become a very short story and Lillian (6 üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏èüë∏ ) and I just got started on writing it in the summer of '21. Every Sunday, I will send you a tiny part of Ruby's TimeShip to help you stay motivated in your programming practice in the coming week.

If you ever decide you don't want our story ‚Äî or your needs change ‚Äî there's an unsubscribe link at the bottom of each and every email. Just click it and we'll part ways, no hard feelings!

If you send me an email complaining about getting too many emails from us, I will immediately delete you from our list.

But really, I don't think it will come to that. Why? Because you're about to get a steady, slow drip of very valuable motivation! üò∫

It'll be like giving your programming practice a weekly shot of vitamin B12.

So.... WELCOME! I'm glad you're here.

## WAIT! DON‚ÄôT TAKE MY WORD FOR IT...
Here‚Äôs what historical engineers have said:

I wish I could turn back the clock and
get weekly motivation reminders when I first started my programming practice - it would have saved me hours of procastination. I always thought I could FORCE myself to practice - but I hit a wall and realized I needed help to get to next level of my own motivation game.

‚Äì Ruby Reckless, Frontend Engineer on Ruby's TimeShip


(ILLU: MARY1 / THE QUEEN OF BRITANNIA)

Dammit, if it wasn't for Ruby's Programming Pirates MY iron hand would have ruled Britannia and Britannia would have Ruled the Waves. And then the Web. Forever....

‚Äì Mary 1, Her Murderous Majesty of Britannia And Badass Backend Engineer


Ruby is a wonderful opponent. She goes out of her way to make your life interesting and will challenge you and do the things that ‚Äì though you might not always want them done to you ‚Äì are crucial to keeping you motivated to stay a successfully scary super spy.

‚Äì Fulvia "The Fox" Renard, Queen Mary's Super Spy

I'd be in prison in The Tower of London if it wasn't for Ruby's Programming Pirates. And you dear reader probably wouldn't have for example William Shakespear's plays and probably not your freedom of speech. Where would you have been without my years of golden rule and the following Golden Age of Pirates that in my humble opinion laid the groundwork for the American Constitution. Don't thank me, thank my half sister Ruby Reckless.

‚Äì Lizabeth, Princess of England and later Queen.

Ruby Reckless, you finally convinced me to drop trying to practice several programming skills at once. I‚Äôve now focused on Gatsby functions practice since the start of August 2021. Just wanted to say thank you.

‚Äì Ola Vea, Junior Frontend Engineer on POW!



### ABOUT THE AUTHOR
Hi! I‚Äôm Ola Vea and I wasn't always a JUST ANOTHER FRIENDLY Frontend Engineer I grew up at sea. I grew up in a city, but I spent every summer at sea onboard my father's ship full of youngsters. We crossed the North Sea looking like a sunny mirror and we crossed the North Sea with waves the size of our tiny, white, wood house where I now live with my wife Benedicte and our daughter Lillian (6 üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏èüë∏ ). If I had to choose ONE thing I learned from my seafaring life, it is this:

#### Learning by Doing.

Teaching us Learning by Doing was my father's purpose in life. His misson as a teacher and as a father.
And I guess when he died I inherited the Learning by Doing mission.

My father used his traditional sailing ship as a tool to show us that we already knew how to learn. My father made Learning by Doing easy and safe for his pupils and for my sister and for me and for our friends. My misson is to use your programming practice to show you that you already know how to learn.

You‚Äôre running out of web page! Don‚Äôt spend another day believing that the solution to your programming practice woes is waiting around for motivation while you are distracted by something else.

My father's name was also Ola Vea


Except the summer of 1993. That summer I spent two months in the weird woods of upstate New York, near Woodstock and also some weeks in Queens NYC. It was a summer camp, if you've ever been to one. No girls.
I have lived 1.5 years in Boston, Massaschusettes and spent 1 year sailing down to the Orinoco river in Venezuela and almost all the way back to Oslo, Norway, Europe. Where I now live in a tiny, white, wood house with my wife Benedicte and our daughter Lillian (6 :pirate_flag: :princess:  ) And my mother in law as our nearest neighbour. And her grumpy cat Smidig, named after the Agile methodology. We live almost downtown Oslo, but our neighbourhood is like a village with kids playing in the streets and people coming from all over town to stroll and look at our 100 year old houses.
