By Lillian Raae-Vea (6 🏴‍☠️👸 ) and Ola Vea

PROLOG  PART 1 ( // bold)

Three half sisters,
all alike in programming prowess,
On lucky London Bridge,
where we start our story.

On the verge of
going crazy
in house arrest,
Ruby Reckless, the junior
half sister is surprised
when her favourite sister is jailed
together with every
frontend engineer
on London Bridge except herself.

Ruby recklessly escapes 1554
for the far future and
teams up with
a Gatsby programming
pirate Princess,
to properly practice
Gatsby functions and
make a CRUSHING comback in 1554.
