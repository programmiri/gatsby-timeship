Inside the almost testable TimeShip on a summery Sunday morning. On London Bridge in 1554.

«Let's get a Gatsby Function going. Why don't you read out the tiny tasks to me?» Says Ruby

«Ok. So start with a
src / api folder and a time-travel.js file and
export a Gatsby function that calls
res.send("You time-travelled to the city of Oslo, in year 2026")
» Says Lizabeth, while Ruby hammers away on her keyboard like a wild woodpecker.

«Hack-hack-hack!» Says Ruby's keyboard.

«But, but....» Says Lizabeth.

«MoooHa-Ha-HA-A! Done!» Says Ruby, stuffing computer and keyboard into her purple backpack.

«Wait.... How do you know
AND WHY DID
YOU WRITE
req-the-bat
INTO THE
GATSBY
FUNCTION!?» Shouts Lizabeth after Ruby and req-the-bat.

«Know-schmow, people don't call me Ruby Reckless for no reason. Now move!» Shouts Ruby over her shoulder and climbs as an ape along a rope to the next-door rooftop.

«ARR! Well I guess nobody is better suited to show us if this Gatsby Function weirdness works than our neighbour and friend Freddie Catsby, his glamorous self.» Says Lizabeth and climbs after Ruby.
