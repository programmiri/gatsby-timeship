4 PIRATY GATSBY FUNCTIONS TO JAILBREAK A SISTER
By Lillian Raae-Vea (6 🏴‍☠️👸 ) and Ola Vea

PROLOG  PART 1 ( // bold)

Three half sisters,
all alike in programming prowess,
On lucky London Bridge,
where we start our story.

On the verge of
going crazy
in house arrest,
Ruby Reckless, the junior
half sister is surprised
when her favourite sister is jailed
together with every
frontend engineer
on London Bridge except herself.

Ruby recklessly escapes 1554
for the far future and
teams up with
a Gatsby programming
pirate Princess,
to properly practice
Gatsby functions and
make a CRUSHING comback in 1554.

PROLOG PART 2 ( // bold)

But when Ruby's 1554 jailbreak
fails to deploy properly
she must learn to focus on
programming playfuller,
even when live coding.
WHILE London Bridge is burning.

Or, firstly,
fail to get
Lizabeth out of jail.

And secondly,
fail to stop their third
half sister, Queen
murderous Mary from
demolishing all
the homes of Ruby's
frontend engineer friends
and re-building
London Bridge
as a boringly
bad back end.

But, we'll start
at the start.
Let's get a Gatsby function going!
