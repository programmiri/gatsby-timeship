By Lillian Raae-Vea (6 üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏èüë∏ ) and Ola Vea


PROLOG
Three half sisters,
all alike in programming prowess,
On lucky London Bridge,
where we start our story.

On the verge of
going crazy
in house arrest
Ruby Reckless, the junior
half sister is surprised
when her fav. sister is jailed
together with every
frontend engineer
in London except herself.

Ruby recklessly escapes
to the far future and
teams up with
a Gatsby programming
pirate Princess,
to properly practice
Gatsby functions and
make a CRUSHING comback in 1554.

But when the jailbreak
fails to deploy properly
Ruby must learn to
"Never trust
the User".
While programming
London's 4 greatest
Gatsby Functions,
to get Ruby's sister Lizabeth
out of the Tower
of London jail.

And stop their
half sister, Queen
murderous Mary from
demolishing all their homes
and re-building
London Bridge
as a boringly
bad back end.

But, we'll start
at the start.
Let's get a Gatsby function going!


garbage:
focus
on just ONE
tiny programming task
at the time
even when live coding

and filling ever house
with wolfy
backend engineers.
