Lizabeth and Ruby climb along a few rooftops, save a starving red cat from a tall tree and knock on Freddie Catsby's glamorously gilded door.

«Hello again my beauties!» Says Freddie Catsby with a toothy smile under his piratical mustache.

«Iiiiin the mooorning Mr Catsby here is your coffee and your cat sir, can you please show us if our Gatsby function is working?» Ruby asks with a deep courtsey.

«Yes it would be my pleasure, just show me your code.» Says Freddie Catsby.

«Ok. Here is my Gatsby function.» Says Ruby


src / api / time-travel.js

export default function timeTravelHandler(req, res) {
 res.send("You time-travelled to Oslo, year 2026")
}


«Good. Good. And look, in your browser is your text string

“You time-travelled to Oslo, year 2026”

http://localhost:8000/api/time-travel

So what is your next task?» Asks Freddie Catsby.

«We need to get our landing city from the TimeShip browser bar and into our Gatsby function.» Says Lizabeth.
