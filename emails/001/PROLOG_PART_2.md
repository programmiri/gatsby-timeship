PROLOG PART 2 ( // bold)

But when Ruby's 1554 jailbreak
fails to deploy properly

fail to get
Lizabeth out of jail.

And secondly,
fail to stop their third
half sister, Queen
murderous Mary from

the homes of Ruby's
frontend engineer friends
and re-building
London Bridge
as a boringly
bad back end.

But, we'll start
at the start.
Let's get a Gatsby function going!
