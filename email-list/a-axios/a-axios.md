Here's how I practice adding and using axios:
- Arrow drawing ->
- Lettering
- Check cheatsheet
- Repeat
- Repeat until my countdown timer croaks "rrr-RRR!"

On my own piraty print-outs.

Examples:

Add axios with Arrows ->
I find the "right" word by guessing and draw an arrow to the number 1 in my Gatsby function code on my piraty print-out.

(// illu #A1)

Using axios with Lettering
I guess the "right" word and letter it by the number 3 outside my Gatsby function code on my piraty print-out.

(// illu #A2)

(// illu #A3)

Check Cheatsheet & Repeat
I check my cheatsheet and repeat and repeat and repeat. Until my countdown timer croaks "rrr-RRR!"
