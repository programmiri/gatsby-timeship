Ship Ahoy Skill Builder!

One of my tiny tasks this week was:
– Change your stripe session to pay-what-you-want.

What did I do?
I set a timer for 1 hour and 28 minutes and coded the solution over and over and over exactly the same. Because that way I automate the tiny task in my brain.


Why did I do it?
Automating the tiny task in my brain is skill building. You can automate your tiny task in your brain, but it is painful for the brain to do the exact same thing over and over. So you need to change up something other than the actual code.

How did I do it?
One way I "changed up something" was filling out the blanks on a print-out of the code. The print-out of the code looked like this before.

The print-out of the code looked like this after.

I did the print-out thing many times, on many print-outs. Because I focus more intensly with pen and paper than with my computer. And I needed to focus intensly to keep me going the last fistful of times I was redoing the exersise. 😬 Pain is temporary, skill building is FOREVER!

Print out and try it for yourself 🖊️😺👍.

Keep your skill building boat aflot this week!
