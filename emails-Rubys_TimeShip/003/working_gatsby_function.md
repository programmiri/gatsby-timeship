Lizabeth and Ruby climb along a few rooftops. Together they save res-the-cat from a dangerously tall tower and knock on Freddie Catsby's glamorously gilded door.

«Hello again my beauties!» Says Freddie Catsby with a toothy smile.

«Iiiiin the mooorning Mr Catsby, here is your cat and coffee sir, can you please show us if our new Gatsby function is working?» Lizabeth asks with a deep courtsey.

«Yes indeed, it would be my pleasure, just show me your code.» Says Freddie Catsby.

«Ok. Here.» Says Ruby

src / api / time-travel.js

export default function timeTravelHandler(req, res) {
 res.send("You time-travelled to Oslo, year 2026")
}


«Good. Good. Your code is telling res-the-cat to send “You time-travelled to the city of Oslo, in year 2026”. And in localhost you see that res-the-cat sent it. And here Lizabeth, take res-the-cat as a good bye gift. I know how much you love cats and dogs and horses.» Says Freddie Catsby.

«Thank you sooo much Freddie, but where are YOU going? Don't you have your Friday show at the Tower of London?» Says Lizabeth.

«YOU are going to the Tower of London before me. At least that is the rumour on Our Bridge. Queen murderous Mary is going to gruesomly jail you on trumped up treason charges any day.» Says Freddie Catsby.

«Oh! Ok, we'll have to hurry then. So we can escape on our TimeShip test trip, before super spy Fulvia "The Fox" Renard finds fake proof against me.» Says Lizabeth.

«Yes you must hurry. So what is your next tiny task?» Asks Freddie Catsby.

«We need to get our landing city from the TimeShip browser bar and into our Gatsby function.» Says Lizabeth.
