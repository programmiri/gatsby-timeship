Chapter 1
Summer Is Coming ( // bold)

In The Pink and Yellow TimeShip,
on Princess Lizabeth's and Ruby's rooftop,
on London Bridge,
in year 1554.

The sun is shining, the gulls are sining, it's a LOVELY morning.
Lizabeth and Ruby are busy programming, as they have been busy programming every morning the whole spring. Programming to forget their horrid house arrest. Just a few lines of code are left before they can go on their first TimeShip test trip!

«Let's get this Gatsby function going. Why don't you read out the first tiny task to me?» Says Ruby.

«Ok. So, start with a
src / api folder and a
time-travel.js file and
export a Gatsby function that calls
res.send("You time-travelled to
the city of Oslo,
in year 2026")» Says Lizabeth, while Ruby hammers away on her keyboard like a wild woodpecker.

«MoooHa-Ha-HA-A! Done!» Says Ruby, stuffing computer and keyboard into her purple backpack.

«Wait....
How do you know....
And why did
you write
req-the-bat
INTO THE
GATSBY
FUNCTION!?» Shouts Lizabeth after Ruby.

«Know-schmow, people don't call me Ruby Reckless for no reason. Now move!» Shouts Ruby over her shoulder and climbs as an ape along a rope towards the next-door rooftop. req-the-bat opens one half hooded eye, she knows the order to "move" is meant for her, but she has a drowsy doze going...

«ARR! Well I guess nobody is better suited to show us if this Gatsby Function weirdness actually works than our neighbour and friend Freddie Catsby, his glamorous self. Move your lazy wings req, it's the first time we're leaving the house in 3 months.» Says Lizabeth and ties the coffee thermos and cup to her belt and climbs hand over hand after Ruby.
