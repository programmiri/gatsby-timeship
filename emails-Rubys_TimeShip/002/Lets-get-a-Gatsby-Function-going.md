## Chapter 1
# Summer Is Coming

In Ruby's TimeShip,
on Princess Lizabeth's rooftop,
on London Bridge,
An early March morning in the year 1554.

Req-the-bat hangs dozing while Lizabeth and Ruby are busy programming to forget their horrid house arrest. Just a few lines of code are left before they can go on their first TimeShip test trip!

«Sunny shiny and I feel okay
That's cause we're coding today
Sunny shiny and I feel okay.»  Sings Lizabeth.

«I have my coffee
and I have my keyboard
and EVERY piece of our chocolate hoard
I have my coffee
and I have my keyboard TODAAAY!» Sings Ruby Reckless.

«It reminds me of our first pro-gramming
it was sunny summer all gulls a-sininging.» Sings Lizabeth.

«Let's get this Gatsby function going. Why don't you read out the first tiny task to me?» Says Ruby Reckless.

«Ok. So, start with a
src / api folder and a
time-travel.js file and
export a Gatsby function that calls
res.send(`You time-travelled to
the city of Oslo,
in year 2026`)» Says Lizabeth, while Ruby hammers away on her keyboard like a wild woodpecker.

«MoooHa-Ha-HA-A! Done!» Says Ruby Reckless, shoulders her keyboard strap and puts her computer on as a backpack.

«Wait.... How do you know you won't be reported for leaving our house arrest!?» Shouts Lizabeth after Ruby.

«Know-schmow, people don't call me Ruby Reckless for no reason!» Shouts Ruby over her shoulder and climbs as an ape along a rope towards the next-door rooftop. req-the-bat opens one half hooded eye, she has a dreamily, drowsy doze going...

«ARR! Well I guess nobody is better suited to show us if this Gatsby Function weirdness actually works than our neighbour and friend Freddie Catsby, his glamorous self. Are you coming req, you lazy lass, it's the first time we're leaving the house in 3 months. Guess not.» Says Lizabeth and ties the coffee thermos and cup to her belt and climbs hand over hand after Ruby.
