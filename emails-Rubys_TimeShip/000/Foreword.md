SUBJECT
Ruby’s TimeShip ⛵ and a skill building question

Welcome aboard skill builder! 🔧😺🏴‍☠️

Ruby’s TimeShiP will soon start, but first let Lillian (6 🏴‍☠️👸 ) and me ask you a pretend question.
Let's piratically pretend your workplace situation forced you to focus on only one frontend skill to build.

And let's pretend it was your piratical choice just what that one frontend skill should be. Because in my 6.6 years of experience of frontend skill building, I have found that trying to build more than one frontend skill at the time is MY Number One skill-building-enemy.

So please give Lillian (6 🏴‍☠️👸 ) and me a chance at getting to know you just a little better and hit reply and write the name of that one frontend skill you would have focused on building.

I'll read your reply out loud to Lillian (6 🏴‍☠️👸 ) and that will make me a gladder Gatsby Piraty Captain 🥳🏴‍☠️
​
​See you on a Sunday 👋😺☀️

## Foreword

Three half sisters,
all alike in programming prowess,
On lucky London Bridge,
where we start our story.

A sisterly rivalry,
gone royally wrong.
Will royal blood
make royal hands unclean?

Between these two
hostile half sisters
stands our hero,
half sister Ruby.

Only person
can stop the sisterly strife
Only our
skill building hero,
Ruby Reckless.

On the verge of
going crazy
in house arrest,
Ruby Reckless,
is building her
frontend skill
to stay sane.

Ruby is building her TimeShip
to recklessly rescue
her half sister
Princess Lizabeth
from freedomless 1554.
And time travel to
a future free of fear.

And there team up with
a Gatsby programming
pirate Princess,
to properly practice
serverless
Gatsby functions and
make a CRUSHING comeback in 1554.

But can Ruby learn
to stay focused on
building only one
frontend skill?

Or else, firstly,
fail to save her sister
Lizabeth from poxy prison.
In the Terrible Tower
of London.

And secondly,
fail to stop their third
half sister, Queen
murderous Mary 1 from
demolishing all
the homes of Ruby's
London Bridge friends
and re-building
London Bridge
as a boringly
bad back end.
