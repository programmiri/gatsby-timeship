PROLOG

Three half sisters,
all alike in programming prowess,
On lucky London Bridge,
where we start our story.

A sisterly rivalry,
gone royally wrong.
Incivil deeds,
spreading a plague of
Incivility and Tyranny
throughout London.

On the verge of
going crazy
in house arrest,
Ruby Reckless,
is building a TimeShip
to recklessly escape
evil 1554
for the far future
and there
team up with
a Gatsby programming
pirate Princess,
to properly practice
serverless
Gatsby functions and
make a CRUSHING comeback in 1554.

But can Ruby learn to focus on
programming playfuller,
even when live coding?

Or else, firstly,
fail to save her sister
Lizabeth from real jail.
In the Terrible Tower
of London.

And secondly,
fail to stop their third
half sister, Queen
murderous Mary from
demolishing all
the homes of Ruby's
London Bridge friends
and re-building
London Bridge
as a boringly
bad back end.
