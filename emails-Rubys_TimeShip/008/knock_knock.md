«Get onboard Lizabeth! I've deployed my TimeShip to Gatsby cloud. I'll take you away on a test trip and rescue you from this horrid house arrest.» Says Ruby.

«Knock! Knock! In the Queen's name! Open up!» Booms a voice from down on the Bridge below.

«Who's there!?» Ruby ask the wind.

«Hack-hack! Hack!» Floats up the answer on the salty wind.

«Wolf-Wolf! Fox-fox!» Croaks Kiwi, who looks down.

«OH! No! It's the Constable of the Tower of London. With him is super spy Fulvia "The Fox" Renard and a pack of her wolfy backend buddies are hacking at my door with halberds. My my.» Says Lizabeth and calmly shakes her head and looks down on The Bridge below.

«Noooo! Why must the STUPID super spy stop us now! We're SOOO close!» Says Ruby.

«Yes super spy Fulvia "The Fox" Renard was blazingly fast at finding fake proof against me. Now Queen Mary can lock me up in the Tower and just wait until I am covicted by her kangaroo court. But YOU can still get away Ruby.» Says Lizabeth.

«Without you? WHY?! Getting YOU out of horrible house arrest is The Whole Point! Please come away with me.» Says Ruby and holds out her hand.

«No. I will just look guilty if I run away now, awaiting my treason trail. You must go alone to the far future. And TimeShip yourself and the Pirate Princess back here. And break me out of The Tower. And make a safe getaway for us. That's three NEW Gatsby functions for you to master. I know it's a lot, but you CAN do it.» Says Lizabeth,

«Of course I can do it alone. ALONE! How can I learn three new Gatsby functions? How can I go to the far future without my sister and leave her to rot in jail? It's too much I cannot go alone. Aloooone.» Ruby sits down heavily on the tiny deck of her pink and yellow TimeShip.

«Ka-Boom! Crash!» Acrid cannon smoke wafts up from the Bridge below..

«My, oh my. I'll need to get a new front door made. I should go down before they make a mess looking for me. Here take Captain Json's gilded pirate hat for good luck!» Says Lizabeth.

«Good luck!? Yeah I'll need THAT! .... Whatever.» Says Ruby head in hands.

«Miiiiauuuw?!» Asks res-the-cat and jumps lightly onto the keyboard on Ruby's lap.

«Are you also going crazy in house arrest....» Says Ruby and strokes res-the-cat.

«Purrrr!» Says res-the-cat.

«Beep! Dudulappedu! Boop!» Squeeks req-the-bat and flaps down from up under deck and lands on Ruby's slouched shoulder.

«Look at that! You have a full crew! It's a great crew. Take it!» Says Lizabeth.

«OK! Stop plaguing me already! I'll go. I know I'm your only hope Lizabeth. I will go to the far future and make my comeback with a Great Gatsby Pirate Princess. Together we will write The Three Greatest Gatsby Functions of London Bridge and save you from Mighty Mary's Mad Masterplan!


«Can Ruby save me and Our Bridge? Yes. She. Can!» Lizabeth hugs Ruby and climbs down into the house through the rooftop window.

«Req! Res! Look lively! May the Boop be with you Lizabeth!» Ruby waves Captain Json's gilded pirate hat and pushes the start button and ....

«Rrr-RRR!» Says the pink and yellow TimeShip.

«Ka-Poof!»

A pink and yellow cloud mushrooms up, up and up high over London Bridge. Pink and yellow snowflakes float down, like large gull feathers.

P.S

I am so pleased to see your still here!

By "here", I mean the back story of ... inner circle of our email list :)

We do things a bit differently here as you might have noticed, so let me prepare you for what's about to come...

For six years I've been obsessed with practicing programming in a way that
makes building your best programming skill dramatically playfuller.

Sure, I could dump all of my thoughts about this on a website and call it a day, but that would be like sending you to a musty old library and leaving you there by yourself.

Articles on a website are not interactive - they're just a bunch of static posts that you'd anonymously dig through (and probably out of order).

Instead, I will send out what I've discovered about playfuller programming practice bit by bit in real time. I believe that you'll learn (and put things into action) much better this way.

Best of all, I'll invite you to reply with questions, comments, cheers and jeers in every message. Unlike a website, email is inherently two-way and I look forward to reading every reply.

Every Sunday, I will send you something to help you improve your programming practice.

The five main topic areas that I'll cover are Gatsby Functions, playfull programming practice, mindfull programming practice, automating tiny tasks, and using storytelling to help memorize important things.

You're going to get a ton of value, delivered in your inbox.

I am also going to—surprise!!—tell you about my products and services.

If you ever decide you don't want this information—or your needs change—there's an unsubscribe link at the bottom of each and every email. (Look, here's one now! {{ unsubscribe_url }}). Just click it and we'll part ways, no hard feelings!

If you send me an email complaining about getting too many emails from me, I will immediately delete you from my list.

But really, I don't think it will come to that. Why? Because you're about to get a steady, slow drip of very useful information! :)

It'll be like giving your Programming practice a weekly shot of vitamin B12.

So.... WELCOME! I'm glad you're here.

Please hit the REPLY button in your email client right now and give me a 1-sentence summary of what your last successful Gatsby practice session looked like for your business. Heck, even a short phrase is fine. I'd really love to know!
